Updates the various [sub].retrozelda.com domains to point to this machine when the network is reconnected.

NOTE: Make sure to update users and folder paths in the files because i couldnt be bothered to make them more generic. 

This uses the SiteWorx API.  The authenticated user exists inside of .key as a JSON container the "email" and "password"
This .key file is required for the update_dns.py script to run properly.  Python 3 is required.

on-network-reconnect.sh is what will run the python script as the current user.
on-network-reconnect.service is the service that we need to install

use ./install.sh as root to install the service
use ./uninstall.sh as root to uninstall the service

all logs will end up in ./logs
and the last run will also be logged to ./latest.log

a .ip_cache file will be created so we dont attempt any DNS edits if the IP hasnt changed.
Delete this file to force update.
